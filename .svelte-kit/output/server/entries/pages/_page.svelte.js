  <h3>More background</h3>
  <p>I studied Linguistics for my undergraduate major, and Computational and
    Statistical Linguistics for my student-designed minor. Data visualization
    was my way to practice programming and statistics together‚Äîthis was indeed a
    great approach and led me to various areas in HCI, including system design,
    visualization grammar, and design research. I am a first-generation PhD student.

  <h3>Responsive Visualization Authoring</h3>
  <p>Data visualization helps us to reason about various problems from daily
    decisions to professional judgment. As different types of devices have
    become affordable to many people, we face more and more visualization use
    cases through diverse device types. I have studied &quot;responsive
    visualization,&quot; referring to adpating visualizations for different device
    types.
  </p>
  <p>I particularly focus on responsive visualization authoring, which is not
    easy because of the lack of guidance in addition to challenges in managing
    multiple versions of charts. A first step to intelligent responsive
    visualization authoring systems is to undertstand a snapshot of current
    practices and trade-offs occuring around those practices. Analyzing 378
    pairs of desktop and mobile versions of communicative visualizations, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.07724" target="_blank">our work</a>
    identifies
    <a href="http://mucollective.github.io/responsive-vis-gallery" target="_blank">a set of 76 design patterns</a>
    and characterize designing responsive visualization as density-message trade-off
    between adjusting graphical density and maintaining visualization insights. To
    facilitate reasoning about insight preservation in an automated way, we contribute
    <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.08141" target="_blank">task-oriented insight preservation measures</a>
    in terms of identification, comparison, and trend insights. More recently, we
    introduce,
    <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.08314" target="_blank">Cicero, a declarative grammar for responsive visualization</a> to better support related authoring systems.

  <h3>Design for Societal Problems</h3>
  <p>Designign for the underrepresetned helps us to communicate better as a
    community. Nevertheless, not every computing device or system is useful for
    the underrepresetned. I am particularly interested in how an understnading
    of a user group impacts the design of a system at a deeper level.

  <h4>Information System for Sexual Violence Survivors</h4>
  <p>For example, sexual violence survivors often have hard time finding suitable
    support services for them due to various societal and personal reasons.
    While personalization is key to navigate a vast search space of
    support-seeking, how to personalize (i.e., how to ask for personalization
    and how to provide personalized information) has been less asked given its
    importance. To understand personalization in a conversational interaction
    setting, we performed a co-design workshop with experts, implemented a
    high-fidelity prototype system, and did a user study with self-identified
    sexual violence survivors.

  <h4>Design Guidelines for the In-game Sexual Harassment Prevention System</h4>
  <p>In online video games, sexual harassment against female gamers frequently
    occurs, and becomes worse with various factors. This research projects
    attempted to suggest design guidelines that both prevent harrassment. A shor
    paper for this project was published in HCI Korea 2018 Conference (extended
    abstract). <a href="pubs/ingame-sexual-harassment-2018.pdf" target="_blank">Download Preprint (Korean)</a></p>

  <h3>Media-as-Place Storytelling</h3>
  <p>From escape rooms to <i>Sara is Missing...</i> and <i>Searching...</i>, we
    experience a new kind of narratives where their places seem identical to
    their media: real objects in escape rooms, a smartphone for
    <i>Sara is Missing...</i>, and a computer for <i>Searching...</i>. We shed
    light on this emerging storytelling technique by identifying it as
    &#39;Media-as-Place&#39; storytelling. This approach will enhance place-based
    learning of HCI as well as enriching our digital narrtaive techniques.
