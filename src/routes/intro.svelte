  <h3>More background</h3>
  <p>
    I studied Linguistics for my undergraduate major, and Computational and
    Statistical Linguistics for my student-designed minor. Data visualization
    was my way to practice programming and statistics together—this was indeed a
    great approach and led me to various areas in HCI, including system design,
    visualization grammar, and design research. I am a first-generation PhD student.
